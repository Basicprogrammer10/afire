// Import Lib
use afire::{Server, Method, Response, Header, Content};

// Create Server
let mut server = Server::<()>::new("localhost", 8080);

// Add a route
server.route(Method::GET, "/greet/{name}", |req| {
  let name = req.param("name").unwrap();

  Response::new()
    .text(format!("Hello, {}", name))
    .content(Content::TXT)
});

// Start the server
