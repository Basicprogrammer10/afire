A blazing fast dependency free web framework for Rust

## ðŸ’  Install

Just add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
afire = "1.2.0"
```

## ðŸ“„ Info

This is kinda like express.js for rust. It is not _that_ complicated but it still makes development of APIs / web servers much easier. It supports Middleware and comes with some built in for Static File Serving, Rate limiting,  more.

For more information on this lib check the docs [here](https://crates.io/crates/afire)

## ðŸ’¥ Examples

For some examples go [here](https://github.com/Basicprogrammer10/afire/tree/main/examples).

Here is a super simple example:

```rust
// Import Lib
use afire::{Server, Method, Response, Header, Content};

// Create Server
let mut server: Server = Server::new("localhost", 8080);

// Add a route
server.route(Method::GET, "/greet/{name}", |req| {
  let name = req.path_param("name").unwrap();

  Response::new()
    .text(format!("Hello, {}", name))
    .content(Content::TXT)
});

// Start the server
// This is blocking
server.start().unwrap();
```

## ðŸ”§ Features

Here I will outline interesting features that are available in afire.

- Builtin Middleware

afire comes with some built-in extensions in the form of middleware.
Currently, the built-in middleware includes the following:
- Serve Static
- RateLimit
- Logger
- Response Cache
- Request ID

For these you will need to enable the features.

To use these extra features enable them like this:

```toml
afire = { version = "1.2.0", features = ["extension"] }
```

- Content Types

As an easy way to set the Content-Type of a Response you can use the `.content` method of the Response.
Then you can put one of the common predefined types.

```rust
// Import Lib
use afire::{Server, Method, Response, Header, Content};

// Create Server
let mut server: Server = Server::new("localhost", 8080);

// Add a route
server.route(Method::GET, "/", |_req| {
  Response::new()
    .text("Hello, World!")
    .content(Content::TXT)
});

// Start the server
// This is blocking
server.start().unwrap();
```
/// The Prelude is a collection of very commenly used *things* in afire
/// Unless you are using extentions or internial lower level stuff
